        <p class = 'title'>A Man for All Markets</p>
        <p class = 'author'>Edward O. Thorp</p>
        <p>
          The first autobiography I've read. I'm enjoying this book a lot because it feels simultaneously entertaining and educational.

          <p class = 'title'>How to Win Friends and Influence People</p>
          <p class = 'author'>Dale Carnegie</p>
          <p>
            A great book about human relations that I always enjoy revisiting.
            The lessons I've learned from this book have helped me reflect on and improve upon my interactions with others.

        <p class = 'title'>The Almanack of Naval Ravikant</p>
        <p class = 'author'>Eric Jorgenson</p>
        <p>
          A short, easy read packed with philosophical wisdom about wealth, happiness, and life.
          Inspired me to live a (relatively) minimalist lifestyle and equipped me with methods for finding happiness.
