    <p>Hi! My name is Arthur Lin, and I'm a senior studying finance at the 
       University of Maryland's Robert H. Smith School of Business. I'm currently
       learning web development through <a href = 'https://www.theodinproject.com/'>The Odin Project</a>, and will iteratively 
       build this website as a personal portfolio / whatever else I end up turning
       it into.  
    </p>

    <p>Thanks for visiting!</p>
